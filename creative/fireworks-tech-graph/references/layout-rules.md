# Layout Rules & Validation

## Layout Rules & Validation

**Spacing**:
- Same-layer nodes: 80px horizontal, 120px vertical between layers
- Canvas margins: 40px minimum, 60px between node edges
- Snap to 8px grid: horizontal 120px intervals, vertical 120px intervals

**Arrow Labels** (CRITICAL):
- MUST have background rect: `<rect fill="canvas_bg" opacity="0.95"/>` with 4px horizontal, 2px vertical padding
- Place mid-arrow, ≤3 words, stagger by 15-20px when multiple arrows converge
- Maintain 10px safety distance from nodes

**Arrow Routing**:
- Prefer orthogonal (L-shaped) paths to minimize crossings
- Anchor arrows on component edges, not geometric centers
- Route around dense node clusters, use different y-offsets for parallel arrows
- Jump-over arcs (5px radius) for unavoidable crossings

**Line Overlap Prevention** (CRITICAL - most common bug on Codex):
When two arrows must cross each other, ALWAYS use jump-over arcs to prevent visual overlap:
- Crossing horizontal arrows: add a small semicircle arc (radius 5px, stroke same color as arrow, fill none) that "jumps over" the other line
- SVG pattern for jump-over: use a white/matching-background arc on the lower layer, then draw the upper arc on top
- Multiple crossings: stagger arc radii (5px, 7px, 9px) so arcs don't overlap each other
- Never let two arrows' straight-line segments cross without a jump-over arc

**Validation Checklist** (run before finalizing):
1. **Arrow-Component Collision**: Arrows MUST NOT pass through component interiors (route around with orthogonal paths)
2. **Text Overflow**: All text MUST fit with 8px padding (estimate: `text.length × 7px ≤ shape_width - 16px`)
3. **Arrow-Text Alignment**: Arrow endpoints MUST connect to shape edges (not floating); all arrow labels MUST have background rects
4. **Container Discipline**: Prefer arrows entering and leaving section containers through open gaps between components, not through inner component bodies

## SVG Technical Rules

- ViewBox: `0 0 960 600` default; `0 0 960 800` tall; `0 0 1200 600` wide
- Fonts: embed via `<style>font-family: ...</style>` — no external `@import` (breaks rsvg-convert)
- `<defs>`: arrow markers, gradients, filters, clip paths
- Text: minimum 12px, prefer 13-14px labels, 11px sub-labels, 16-18px titles
- All arrows: `<marker>` with `markerEnd`, sized `markerWidth="10" markerHeight="7"`
- Drop shadows: `<feDropShadow>` in `<filter>`, apply sparingly (key nodes only)
- Curved paths: use `M x1,y1 C cx1,cy1 cx2,cy2 x2,y2` cubic bezier for loops/feedback arrows
- Clip content: use `<clipPath>` if text might overflow a node box
